====================

This repository shows examples of supervised machine learning.

In this type of models, algorithms are trained to find patterns using a set of data. 

This repository shows the two main types of supervised learning: classification and regression.


The classification model uses a 2010 dataframe created by the [US Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.kaggle.com/code/adveros/flight-delay-eda-exploratory-data-analysis).     

In this example, different classification supervised learning models are tested to predict flight delay.
